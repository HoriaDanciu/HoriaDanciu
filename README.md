## Hi there, I'm Horia 👋

Born in Romania 🇷🇴 · Raised in Spain 🇪🇸 · Graduated from UC Berkeley Haas School of Business 🇺🇸

I'm a recent graduate from the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business (B.S. Business Administration) and the College of Computing, Data Science & Society (B.A. Data Science with Economics concentration). My journey gave me something no classroom could: a deep curiosity about how people, markets, and data behave differently depending on where you are—and what patterns hold true no matter what.

⭐ I'm actively seeking opporuntities in data science, product management, and strategy where I can uncover hidden patterns and drive data-backed decisions. 



## 🔍 What I Do 

I transform raw data into actionable insights. Whether it's analyzing millions of records, building complex models, or trying (my best) to forecast the future, I'm driven by the questions hidden in the numbers.



## Core strengths: 

📊 Data Exploration

🤖 Machine Learning

📈 Quantitative Analysis

💡 Business Strategy
